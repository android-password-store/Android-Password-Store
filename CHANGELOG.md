# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   On Android 11, Autofill will use the new [inline autofill](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/ime-autofill#configure-provider) UI that integrates Autofill results into your keyboard app.
-   Allow doing a merge instead of a rebase when pulling or syncing
-   Add support for manually providing TOTP parameters
-   Parse extra content as individual fields
-   Improve search result filtering logic
-   Allow pinning shortcuts directly to the launcher home screen
-   Another workaround for SteamGuard's non-standard OTP format
-   Allow importing QR code from images

### Fixed

-   Pressing the back button in the navigation bar and the one in the toolbar behaved differently
-   App shortcuts would never update once the first 4 were set
-   Clipboard history now attempts to flush through 35 times rather than 20 to combat increased clipboard history item count in Samsung devices
-   .gpg-id file generated by APS did not work with pass CLI
-   All but the latest launcher shortcut would have an empty icon
-   When prompted to select a GPG key during onboarding, the app would crash if the user did not make a selection in OpenKeychain
-   Biometric authentication prompts no longer inexplicably dismiss when an incorrect biometric is entered

### Changed

-   Accessibility autofill has been removed completely due to being buggy, insecure and lacking in features. Upgrade to Android 8 or preferably later to gain access to our advanced Autofill implementation.
-   The settings UI has been completely re-done to dramatically improve discoverability and navigation for users
-   Using the `git://` protocol in the server URL now presents an explicit discouragement rather than a generic error
-   Encrypted data is no longer ASCII armored, bringing it in line with `pass`
-   Removed Bromite from supported Autofill browsers, since they [disable Android autofill](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/FAQ.md#does-bromite-support-the-android-autofill-framework).
-   Changing password generator parameters now automatically updates the password without needing to press the 'Generate' button again
-   The app UI was reskinned to match Google's Material You guidelines
-   Using HTTPS without authentication is now fully supported, and no longer asks for a username
-   Enabling 'Show hidden files and folders' no longer shows Git-related files and folders
-   XkPasswd password generator has been removed in favor of one backed by [Diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
