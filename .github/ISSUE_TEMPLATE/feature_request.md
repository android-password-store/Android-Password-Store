<!--
Thanks for taking the time to file this issue! Here are a few things to check before clicking the submit button :)

1. Make sure you're on the latest version of the app. Features are being added all the time and it is entirely possible what you're requesting has already been added. The current release can be found here: https://github.com/android-password-store/android-password-store/releases/latest.

2. Check the changelog file to confirm that the feature hasn't been added for an upcoming release: https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md.

3. ALWAYS fill this template. If you fail to do so, your issue will be immediately closed with no response. Maintaining open source projects for free is hard work, and we expect users to respect that time and effort by putting in a little bit of their own. A feature request that is clear and explicit in its needs lets us get to work faster.
