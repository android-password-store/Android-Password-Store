     * The story of why the pull operation is committing files goes like this: Once upon a time when
     * the world was burning and Blade Runner 2049 was real life (in the worst way), we were made
     * aware that Bitbucket is actually bad, and disables a neat OpenSSH feature called multiplexing.
     * So now, rather than being able to do a [SyncOperation], we'd have to first do a [PullOperation]
     * and then a [PushOperation]. To make the behavior identical despite this suboptimal situation,
     * we opted to replicate [SyncOperation]'s committing flow within [PullOperation], almost exactly
     * replicating [SyncOperation] but leaving the pushing part to [PushOperation].
